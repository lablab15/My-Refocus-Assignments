My name is Hannah Rewena Lozano. I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Information Technology and Diploma in Computer Studies at STI College. I've been working Freelance as a Video Editor for almost 8 years. I really love to learn, so i decided to pursue my career and refresh my IT skills and continue  as a Web Developer in the future. So I chose and trusted refocus to enhance my ability and improve my knowledge to fulfill my dream job.

My hobbies are playing instruments such as the guitar, piano etc. because as well-known fact that music makes you feel calm and relaxed. I also love travelling because I love discovering new cities and places around the world. I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. I love friendsâ€™ trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.

My goals for this year is to be more committed to Growth and learning. give time to study web development so that you can graduate with a lot of knowledge and have a good job and experience and be able to save to have your own company.

I want to become a Web Developer because Web development allows me to express myself creatively on the internet. Web dev is a fun, creative experience. And this is my Dream Job!
